# Linear Regression

Extend ordinary least squares regression, which uses the hypothesis class of linear regression functions, to non-linear regression functions modeled using polynomial basis functions and radial basis functions

## Steps to run
1. Run the `linearRegression.py` file under the `src` folder
2. Observer the plots generated. One such instance is available in `src\plots`
