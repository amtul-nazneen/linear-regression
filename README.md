## Assignment 1
Extend ordinary least squares regression, which uses the hypothesis class of linear regression functions, to non-linear regression functions modeled using polynomial basis functions and radial basis functions

## Assignment 2
Implementing a fixed-depth decision tree algorithm, that is, the input to the ID3 algorithm will include the training data and maximum depth of the tree to be learned
